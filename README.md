# Simple-chess-game
Chess game built in Python using Tkinter graphics library. Left click to select the piece you want to move, right click to select destination. 

This prototype of a chess game was developed in collaboration with Brandon Leathley (https://github.com/Brandon-Leathley). 

Instructions:
Decide player colors.
When it's your turn, left click to select a piece, then right click on the field you want to move it to*.

Current features:
En passant.
Castling.
Highlighting valid moves.
Pawns curretntly always transform into queens when they reach the end.

Future additions to be made:
Integrate draw features into GUI.
Adjust mouse clikcs to use left clicks always.
Enabling the choice of any legal transformation, not just queens.


*Note: Check with your mouse whether you want Button-2 or Button-3 in line 154 of chessboard_display, when binding it with moveSecond.
